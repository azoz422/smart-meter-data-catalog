# Smart Meter Data Catalog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smda/smart-meter-data-catalog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/smda/smart-meter-data-catalog)

## Welcome

This is a listing containing Smart Meter related datasets (and code repositories that use these datasets). The listing is displayed and searched in [Smart Meter Data Portal](https://smda.github.io/smart-meter-data-portal/).

The **Smart Meter Data Portal**, built by a group from **Georgia Tech**, is part of the **National Science Foundation (NSF) Smart Grid Data Analytics Spoke Project**. The purpose of this website is to provide a mechanism to researchers to **share data and code on Smart Meter Data Analytics**.

The website enables researchers to:
- Find public datasets
- Find applications (code, paper) built on these datasets
- Share datasets and applications (code and paper links) to increase visibility and citations
